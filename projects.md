## Bird Scouts

I developed this application as part of a group project for the `Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Course`. Given the broad topic of wildlife, we refined our project topic to develop an application that is geared towards bird watchers and wildlife enthusiasts.

I worked collaboratively worked with my team members to scrape the web to create a dataset, to train audio and image models on this curated dataset, to develop a LangChain based chatbot, and create a front end GUI using streamlit.
