Hi, I am Shankaradithyaa Venkateswaran, and not to worry, I go by Shankar as well. I'm a final year undergraduate student pursuing my bachelors from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.

My passion lies at the intersection of machine learning and computer systems. I love to immerse myself in exploring the uses of machine learning for various systems and vise versa. To add upon this, I love to write to express myself; to convey knowledge or a story lights the fire of passion inside me.

I drive myself forward to explore more avenues, enhance my knowledge, and ultimately give back to the world, through my research.
